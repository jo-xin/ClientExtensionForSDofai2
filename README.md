# A personal client extension of App Inventor2 for a SD server

Welcome to my personal repository! This is a simple extension created when I was learning how to write an app inventor app which can interact with a local modified Stable Diffusion server.

## About

This project is a simple client that interacts with my server. It's primarily for my own record-keeping

Of course, it cannot work without the server, where lots of changes have been made

## Disclaimer

This project is quite simplistic and reflects my early attempts at coding. I recognize that thereâ€™s much to learn, and any feedback or insights are appreciated.

Also, this project was finished before I started learning Java, and a large part of codes are writen by chatGPT.

Feel free to explore, but keep in mind that this is not intended for broader use.
